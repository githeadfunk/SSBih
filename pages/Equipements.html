                <p>The Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap
Velos combines the proven mass accuracy
and ultra-high resolution of the Orbitrap
mass analyzer, with the increased sensitivity
and improved cycle time of the
LTQ Velos™. The high mass accuracy of the
LTQ Orbitrap Velos increases the speed and
confidence of identification in complex
samples by minimizing false positive identi-
fication. The ultra-high resolution provides
certainty in analytical results by enabling
molecular weight determination for intact
proteins and in-depth analysis of isobaric
species. The new HCD cell in the LTQ
Orbitrap Velos is more efficient, resulting in
improved quantitation of isobaricallylabeled
peptides, such as applications
requiring Tandem Mass Tags (TMT). Electron
Transfer Dissociation (ETD) generates complementary
information for highly sensitive
PTM analyses and de novo sequencing</p>

                <p>
                The QPix 420 Colony Picking System allows you to control selective microbial colony picking. It allows multiple users to select and collect microbial colonies from various receptacles.It is capable of automatically picking in excess of 3000 colonies per hour. This is achieved with an integrated vision, detection, and analysis hardware and software System and a 96-pin head assembly, both custom designed by Molecular Devices.
