                The QPix 420 Colony Picking System allows you to control selective microbial colony picking. It allows multiple users to select and collect microbial colonies from various receptacles.It is capable of automatically picking in excess of 3000 colonies per hour. This is achieved with an integrated vision, detection, and analysis hardware and software System and a 96-pin head assembly, both custom designed by Molecular Devices.
                </p>
                <p>After you have identified potential colonies, the source plate is then imaged in
multiple frames using a CCD camera. These images are processed to produce
a single, large image of the colonies on the source plate. Specific colonies are
then selected for picking using feature selection parameters, such as size,
shape, and proximity.</p>
<p>The instrument picks from a range of source plates including large QTrays,
Omni Trays, and standard Petri dishes using the optional source plate holders.
A fluorescent imaging head is also available. This comprises an LED-based
light source that enables different excitation wavelengths to be selected using
preset filter pairs, a filter for selecting appropriate fluorescence emission
wavelengths, and a sensitive monochrome CCD camera for image acquisition.
When fitted, this fluorescence head can also be used for white light imaging
using the transmitted light source fitted below the source plate holder.
The fluorescent imaging system allows for the addition of fluorescent intensity
parameters in the selection criteria.</p>
